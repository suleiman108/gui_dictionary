# GUI Dictionary

**This Python program made with Tkinter creates a simple GUI for translating words from a few languages (French, Spanish, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Italian) to English.**

## *Features:*

**Language Selection**: Choose the source language from a dropdown menu.
**Word Input** : Enter the word you want to translate (in lowercase).
**Translation**: Click the "Translate" button to get the English translation.
**Result Display**: The translation is displayed in the result label.
**Error Handling**: If no translation is found, an error message is displayed.

## To Run:

**Clone the repo**:`git clone https://github.com/EF-Code/gui_dictionary.git` `cd gui_dictionary`

**Run the script from your terminal**: `python gui_dictionary.py`

**Note:**

This is a basic program and more features would be added in the future e.g:

* Adding more languages.
* Implementing a larger dictionary.
* Adding a search bar.
* Improving the UI.
* The current dictionary contains limited vocabulary.
